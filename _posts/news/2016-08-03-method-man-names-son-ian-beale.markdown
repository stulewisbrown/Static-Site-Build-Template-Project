Apparently Method Man is a huge fan of Eastenders, particularly the character Ian Beale whom he has decided will be the namesake of his seventh son.

"You've got to get it right seventh time round y'know what I'm saying?"

"Ian's been through so much over the years and if he can survive all that, I hope my son will take inspiration from it. It was either that or Minty."

Method is said to have auditioned for the role of the new pub landlord at the Queen Vic but was pipped to the post by Danny Dyer. He was said to be heartbroken.
